What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
cons:
-You may forget.
-It will consume more time and effort.
-You may not choose the right number of commits.
pros:
-You're commits will have logical meanings.
-You will have full control on you're history.
